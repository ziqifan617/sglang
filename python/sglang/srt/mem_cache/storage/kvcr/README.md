# KVCR HiCacheStorage backend

This optional backend uses KVCR's indexed-region public API and NIXL/UCX
transport. Install a compatible KVCR build separately; selecting another
HiCache backend does not import KVCR.

## Ownership and data path

SGLang owns GPU memory, HiCache host pages, scheduling, and host-to-GPU copies.
KVCR owns its deposited DRAM cache:

- Backup: GPU -> HiCache host pages -> KVCR-owned DRAM.
- Restore: local or peer KVCR DRAM -> locked HiCache host pages -> GPU.

This is not a DirectLinker or direct-HBM restore. Peer delivery does not require
an intermediate allocation in the target's KVCR DRAM cache. Unpinned SGLang
host pages are never offered as remote sources.

## Configuration

Enable hierarchical caching, choose `--hicache-storage-backend kvcr`, and use
`--hicache-mem-layout page_first` or `page_first_direct`. Supply inline JSON
through `--hicache-storage-backend-extra-config`, for example:

```json
{
  "control_advertise_host": "<reachable-worker-host>",
  "control_port": 32100,
  "local_dram_bytes": 17179869184,
  "combine_page_reads": true,
  "combine_page_writes": true,
  "prefetch_batch_pages": 512,
  "align_storage_prefix": true
}
```

This is an illustrative configuration, not a model-specific capacity
recommendation. Account separately for GPU cache, HiCache host staging, and
KVCR DRAM. The default rank-local mode allocates KVCR storage on each rank.
Control ports must accommodate the rank offsets and be reachable by peers.
The control endpoint's TCP scheme does not select the NIXL payload transport.

Combined reads/writes are opt-in and apply only to primary KV plus
KV-derived `ALL_PAGES` sidecars. Independent and trailing/checkpoint pools
retain their own transfer and resume-boundary handling. Read batching defaults
to 128 pages; configure the same value on ranks participating in the same
prefetch collective. Query and backup batches remain 128 pages.

Prefix-recency alignment additionally requires
`--hicache-storage-pass-prefix-keys`. It adjusts eviction preference; it does
not reserve source blocks or guarantee residency.

An optional positive `startup_timeout_ms` requires the companion KVCR startup
budget change. Omitting it preserves KVCR's normal startup budget. Transfer
and abandonment deadlines are separate from this initialization setting.

## Remote hints and replicated MLA

Cross-replica discovery requires request-scoped source hints, such as those
provided by the companion in-process Dynamo SGLang integration. A query is
advisory; terminal delivery determines which pages are usable. Missing hints
do not authorize fetching from an unrelated replica.

`share_replicated_mla: true` is an explicit assertion that KV and indexer bytes
are identical across attention TP ranks. It stores one copy on TP0 while every
rank restores into its own host buffers. It requires physical MLA KV, CP=1,
PP=1, and no heterogeneous TP head splitting, and rejects pools other than KV
and indexer. Do not enable it for sharded hybrid state or SWA pools.

The adapter preserves valid resume-boundary sets for trailing/checkpoint
pools. The hybrid controller intersects these sets across ranks instead of
assuming that the minimum scalar hit count is a valid checkpoint.

## Failure handling and diagnostics

Successful or missed operations must reach terminal native completion before
HiCache can reuse their buffers. If native transfer state is uncertain, the
worker exits because HiCache cannot quarantine potentially in-flight pages.
Startup/progress/shutdown failures likewise must not release registered
memory while native access may remain possible.

`diagnostic_telemetry` and `verify_transfer_bytes` are disabled by default.
They are validation tools, not free performance instrumentation. Diagnostic
logging can include storage-key and request identities; retain those logs
according to the deployment's data-handling policy.

## Validation

CPU adapter/controller contracts:

```bash
python test/registered/unit/mem_cache/test_kvcr_storage.py -v
python test/registered/unit/mem_cache/test_buffer_mode_sidecar.py -v
python test/registered/unit/mem_cache/test_pp_prefetch_ticket.py -v
```

Real NIXL host-byte round trips, including multi-pool and shared-MLA cases:

```bash
python test/manual/test_kvcr_storage_native.py -v
```

The native gate requires Linux, compatible KVCR/NIXL/UCX, and adequate shared
memory; provision `/dev/shm` explicitly in containers. It verifies host bytes,
not model accuracy or inference performance. End-to-end validation was run
with GLM5.3, two independently complete TP4 replicas, and in-process Dynamo.
That does not establish arbitrary hybrid-model or multi-node-engine support.
